                        <p>
                            CAteriNgz was founded by Master Chef’s one and only
                            Chef Arnold Purnomo in 2024 with the vision and
                            mission of serving and delivering affordable and
                            quality food to every person in the world. CAteriNgz
                            was first established as an idea imagined by Chef
                            Arnold whom as a kid, was raised in a low economy
                            family thus, he couldn’t afford healthy and
                            nutritious food due to the lack of funds to do so.
                            Eventually, he debuted his career as a renowned chef
                            and created the catering service we now know as
                            CAteriNgz. CAteriNgz is sworn to only use quality
                            products and raw materials in the making of our food
                            products to ensure that the nutrition of every
                            person who eats our food is fulfilled and are able
                            to live long healthy lives. “Good food brings good
                            mood” - Chef Arnold Purnomo
