                            <p>I first came across CAteriNgz from Facebook while I was scrolling through 
                                my explore page and the menu seemed interesting. After registering as a 
                                member on CAteriNgz, I decided to try out the Soto Betawi and after I tasted 
                                it, I can already tell its well made! The Soto had a delicious blend of umami 
                                and creaminess which i enjoyed very much and the meat options were also offered 
                                in either boiled chicken or beef. I ordered the beef option and the portion was 
                                very generous and the texture of the beef was tender and delicious. I recommend 
                                this dish for anyone who is craving hot soup dishes!</p>

                            <p>I first knew about CAteriNgz from my friend and she said that the dishes are healthy and well made 
                                so I decided to give it a try. After scrolling through the CAteriNgz website, I viewed a variety of 
                                delicious looking dishes and since I was craving street food, I decided to order CAteriNgz‚Äôs Nasi Goreng 
                                TekTek and as my food arrived, I immediately gave it a taste. As I was eating the nasi goreng, I was amazed 
                                as the dish tasted amazing as the saltiness was perfect and it was very savory and the best part was it wasn‚Äôt 
                                oily which was a big deal for me because whenever I order nasi goreng, the main problem is the amount of oiliness 
                                in the dish which often made my throat feel unwell but with CAteriNgz‚Äôs nasi goreng, my throat didn‚Äôt face such issue 
                                due to the perfect amount of oil used. Overall, I would recommend ordering food from CAteriNgz as it seems healthy imo

                            <p>I‚Äôm originally from Yogyakarta but I‚Äôm currently living in Tangerang because I am currently studying in 
                                Binus University so I get homesick sometimes. However, I came across this catering website called CAteriNgz 
                                since I was bored of the food i eat day by day on a regular basis. After a few minutes of scrolling through 
                                their dishes, I came across a dish which my mother used to make me as a kid back home which was Nasi Gudeg. 
                                So, I decided to give it a shot and try to order CAteriNgz‚Äôs Nasi Gudeg and to my surprise, it tasted amazing!! 
                                It was as if I was back home eating my mother‚Äôs homemade dishes. The nangka tasted sweet and the krecek was also 
                                flavourful especially with the mix of the opor broth in the Nasi Gudeg. I would recommend this dish for people who 
                                want to try authentic Jogja food!! üòãüòãüòã

                            <p>I was craving some Nasi Padang but I couldn‚Äôt find any restaurants near my area that serves Nasi Padang since my district 
                                is still fairly new. That‚Äôs when i came across CAteriNgz through Instagram story ads. After I scrolled through a variety of 
                                food items in the menu, I finally found Nasi Padang on the menu and in my opinion, it is fairly priced considering the portion 
                                that is being offered. When my food arrived, the food was well packaged so that none of the Padang sauce spilled all over. 
                                Furthermore, the spices in the rendang were in the perfect amount and I could taste the herbs and spices which were well mixed 
                                into the food. They even provided plastic utensils for eating which was a bonus in my opinion as most caterings services and 
                                restaurants sometimes forget to provide such items. I‚Äôd definitely recommend CAteriNgz to my fellow companions and family members 
                                anytime. üî•üî•üî•</p>

                            <p>One day I was hungry and I was getting bored of the same food I usually order every day so I decided to try food from CAteriNgz since my 
                                friend said that the food being served tastes good and is also affordable to buy. After viewing the available food options in the menu, 
                                I decided to give their Mie Goreng TekTek a shot since I haven‚Äôt eaten street food noodles in a while. As my food arrived, I could already 
                                smell the heavenly aroma of the Mie Goreng and judging by the smell, I could already tell that the noodles were well chared and seasoned. 
                                After smelling the delicious aroma of the noodles, I finally decided to eat it and it tastes as amazing as it smells. I could taste the 
                                sweetness from the sweet soy sauce being used, the spicyness from the chili and pepper used as well as the umami flavor from the soy sauce. 
                                Overall, I am satisfied with the food being served at CAteriNgz and I highly recommend others to try it as well.</p>
